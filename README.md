# HYPOTHYROIDSM

## Hypothyroid Disease Prediction Using Decision trees and SVM Classifiers

#### Context
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:  

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

Hypothyroidism is when the thyroid is underactive. When thyroid hormone production drops, your body's processes slow down and change. Hypothyroidism can affect many different systems in your body. Hypothyroidism can affect your metabolism, mental functions, energy level, and bowel movements.

#### 1. Decision Trees
We will use the following trees to classify a whether a patient has hypothyroididm or NOT(negative outcome):

<li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
<li>AdaBoost Classifier</li>

The Adaboost is an optimization techniques for the random forest trees.

#### 2. SVM Models
We will use the following SVM models to to place a patient in the right category with regards to predicting their hypothyroidism status:

<li>Polynomial</li>
<li>Linear</li>
<li>RBF</li>
